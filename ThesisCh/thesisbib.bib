@article{case:hypercube,
	abstract = {An innovative insect-based visual sensor is designed to perform active marker tracking. Without any optics and a field-of-view of about 60$\,^{\circ}$, a novel miniature visual sensor is able to locate flickering markers (LEDs) with an accuracy much greater than the one dictated by the pixel pitch. With a size of only 1 cm3 and a mass of only 0.33 g, the lensless sensor, called HyperCube, is dedicated to 3D motion tracking and fits perfectly with the drastic constraints imposed by micro-aerial vehicles. Only three photosensors are placed on each side of the cubic configuration of the sensing device, making this sensor very inexpensive and light. HyperCube provides the azimuth and elevation of infrared LEDs flickering at a high frequency (&gt;1 kHz) with a precision of 0.5$\,^{\circ}$. The minimalistic design in terms of small size, low mass and low power consumption of this visual sensor makes it suitable for many applications in the field of the cooperative flight of unmanned aerial vehicles and, more generally, robotic applications requiring active beacons. Experimental results show that HyperCube provides useful angular measurements that can be used to estimate the relative position between the sensor and the flickering infrared markers.},

@inproceedings{case:cart3d,
	abstract = {We propose a novel visible light positioning (VLP) system based on a single light emitting diode (LED) using the symmetrical receiver. In the proposed receiver, a horizontal photodetector (PD) is located at the center and four tilted PDs are located symmetrically around the center. Based on the received signal strength (RSS), the high accuracy two-dimensional (2-D) positioning can be easily achieved and the average error is 2.32 cm when the PDs' polar angles are 20{\textdegree}. Moreover, the 3-D location can also be estimated if a reference point is provided and the average error of the 3-D positioning is 3.42 cm. The proposed VLP system avoids the inter-cell interference (ICI) caused by multiple transmitters and achieves the positioning regardless of LED's and PDs' characteristics, which can be easily applied in scenarios with limited LEDs.},

@article{vlc,
	abstract = {Visible light communication (VLC) is a new paradigm that could revolutionise the future of wireless communication. In VLC, information is transmitted through modulating the visible light spectrum (400--700 nm) that is used for illumination. Analytical and experimental work has shown the potential of VLC to provide high-speed data communication with the added advantage of improved energy efficiency and communication security/privacy. VLC is still in the early phase of research. There are fewer review articles published on this topic mostly addressing the physical layer research. Unlike other reviews, this article gives a system prespective of VLC along with the survey on existing literature and potential challenges toward the implementation and integration of VLC.},

@article{book:solar_spectrum,
	abstract = {Using the most recent composite time series of total solar irradiance spaceborne measurements, a solar constant value of 1366.1 Wm−2 is confirmed, and simple quadratic expressions are proposed to predict its daily value from the Zurich sunspot number, the MgII index, or the 10.7 cm radio flux index. Whenever these three indices are available on a daily basis (since 1978), it is possible to predict the sun's irradiance within 0.1% on average, as accurately as current measurements. Based on this value of the solar constant, an improved approximation of the extraterrestrial solar spectrum from 0 to 1000 μm is proposed. It is obtained by dividing the spectrum into nine bands and selecting representative (and recent) spectra, as well as appropriate scaling coefficients for each band. Comparisons with frequently used spectra are discussed, confirming previous findings of the literature. This synthetic and composite spectrum is proposed at 0.5-nm intervals in the UV (280--400 nm), 1-nm intervals between 0--280 and 400--1705 nm, 5-nm intervals between 1705 and 4000 nm, and progressively larger intervals beyond 4 μm, for a total of 2460 wavelengths.},
